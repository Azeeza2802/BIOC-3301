# Correlation coefficient: spearman.				
# The parametric p-value(s) were calculated using a one-sided (negative association) test of significance using a t-distribution.				
# The nonparametric p-value(s) were calculated using a one-sided (negative association) permutation test with 999 permutations.				
# The confidence interval(s) were constructed at a confidence level of 95.0% using Fisher's z-transformation (see Sokal and Rohlf 3rd edition pg. 575). The confidence interval(s) are two-sided.				
# Number of samples that matched between the taxa summary files: 30
